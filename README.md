Workshop Title:

"Making Maths Magical: Engaging Strategies for Middle School Teachers"

Duration: 1 hour

Target Audience: Teachers of classes 1 to 7

Objective: To equip teachers with practical techniques and fun activities that make maths relatable and exciting for young students.

PART 1: INTRODUCTION (5 mins)

Speech:
"Good morning everyone!
Thank you for joining me today for this special workshop on Making Maths Magical. Maths is not just about numbers and formulas—it’s a language, a puzzle, a game, and a way of thinking. But for many students, it can feel scary or boring. Today, we’re going to break that pattern and explore ways to make maths fun, interactive, and meaningful—especially for classes up to 7th grade."

PART 2: WHY STUDENTS DISLIKE MATHS (5 mins)

Speech:
"Let’s first understand the problem. Many students say, 'Math is hard,' or 'It’s not for me.' This often happens because:

Maths is taught as memorization, not understanding

Real-life applications are missing

It feels like a test, not a discovery

But we, as educators, can change that by making maths feel alive in the classroom."
(Ask teachers: “What do your students struggle with most in maths?”)

PART 3: FUN TASK 1 – MATHS TREASURE HUNT (10 mins)

Task (Group Activity):
Hide clues around the room with simple math problems (e.g., 12 + 8 = ?; go to the area with that number label). Let teachers try it out in pairs.
Speech:
"This kind of activity makes kids move, solve, and work in teams. It’s a great way to reinforce basic operations and logical thinking."

PART 4: STRATEGIES TO MAKE MATHS INTERESTING (15 mins)

1. Use Stories and Themes
"Turn a problem into a story. For example: 'Rani wants to split 12 laddoos among 4 friends. How many will each get?' Stories stick!"
2. Games and Manipulatives

Use dice, playing cards, flashcards, and coins

Try board games like math bingo or multiplication snakes & ladders

3. Real-Life Maths

Ask kids to calculate the total cost in a canteen menu

Measure classroom items (length, area, volume)

Bring price tags, bills, and coins to class

4. Visuals and Videos

Use YouTube math songs, puzzles, and animations

Draw on the board with colors to show patterns or steps

5. Math Art

Create Rangoli with symmetrical patterns

Teach fractions using paper folding or pizza slices

PART 5: FUN TASK 2 – BUILD-A-GAME CHALLENGE (10 mins)

Task:
Teachers pair up to invent a simple classroom math game using paper, dice, or flashcards. Each group presents the idea in 1 minute.
Speech:
"This promotes creativity, and students love games. Even if it's simple, they'll engage more because it feels like play."

PART 6: CLOSING TIPS & Q&A (10 mins)

Closing Speech:
"Math is not just about getting the right answer. It’s about thinking, exploring, and trying. If we can make our students feel that maths is like solving a mystery or playing a game, we’ve already won half the battle.
Remember:

Keep it visual

Keep it real

Keep it playful

Keep it joyful

Even a small change in how we teach can spark a lifelong love for maths."
Invite questions or sharing of teachers’ favorite techniques.
